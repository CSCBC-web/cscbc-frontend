## Sunday School

The adult Sunday School of the church will be held on each Sunday morning 9:30-10:30am in FLC, and we will discuss the scriptures we read during the prior week.

The church encourages brothers and sisters to participate in the churchâ€™s Bible reading and Sunday school regularly. The Bible reading plan for 2025 can be found [here](https://pub-89e9920648c44264b2116fe675041bf5.r2.dev/CSCBC2025BibleReadingPlan.pdf).
